# Rails Rest Tester

A very simple app using the [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) gem to tinker with GET and POST requests and examine the server output.

This is an exercise for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/basic-routes-views-and-controllers?ref=lnav).
